    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I worked on ray generation, ray tracing, creating bounding volume hierarchies, and illumination.
      <br>
      <br>
      In part 1, I worked on camera ray generation from image coordinates to world coordinates, raytracing on pixels,
      and primitive intersections of rays with triangles and spheres.
      <br>
      In part 2, I work on optimizing the raytracing process by creating bounding volume hierarchies in order to speed
      up the raytracing process. By using BVHs, I can prune the search space for intersections by ignoring primitives
      that are in a larger bounding box that the ray does not intersect.
      <br>
      In part 3, I work on direct illumination by implementing a hemisphere and important lighting function that
      calculates the illumination on a surface from a light source.
      <br>
      In part 4, I work on global illumination by not only including direct illumination of light rays from a light
      source to an object, but also how light rays bounce off objects onto other objects and affect the illumination of
      the scenery.
      <br>
      Finally, in part 5, I work on optimizing the raytracing process by implementing adaptive sampling. This means that
      for some pixels that converge relatively quickly, I can pre-emptively stop sampling rays for that pixel and move
      on to the next pixel since any further samples would likely not contribute much to the final color of the pixel.

    <h3>
      Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In this part, I worked on camera ray generation from image coordinates to world coordinates, raytracing on pixels
      of the image, and primitive intersections of rays with triangles and spheres.
      <br><br>
      In our rendering pipeline, we use a model of light that suggests light travels in straight rays from a light
      source to potentially other objects, ultimately reflecting into the camera lens. In a naive implementation, this
      would involve casting rays from all light sources in every direction even if the ray would not ultimately hit the
      camera and would therefore be effectively wasted computation. To solve this, we use camera rays to create our
      rendered images by casting rays from the camera to each pixel, randomly sampling many rays for each pixel, to get
      the light and ultimately RGB value for each pixel. Primitive intersection is used to check for ray intersections
      with the given shape, which is important in light calculations and whether rays are blocked, etc.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>
      Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The triangle intersection algorithm I used was the Moller Trumbore intersection algorithm. I used the formulas
      found on the slide below.
    </p>
    <img src="images/slide-22.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="600px" />
    <p>
      In my implementation, I compute the above intermediate vectors and ultimately arrive at the [t, b1, b2] vector we
      see. t is the time of intersection of the ray with the triangle. (1 - b1 - b2), b1, b2 are barycentric coordinates
      that describe the point of intersection on the triangle. After calculating these values, I check the validity of t
      and the barycentric coordinates (whether t is within the min_t and max_t, the barycentric coordinates are within
      the range [0, 1], and the sum of the barycentric coordinates is less than or equal to 1). If all of these
      conditions are met, then the ray intersects the triangle, and I update the relevant data structures. Specifically,
      I update the ray's max_t to the t value I calculated, then update the corresponding members of the intersection
      data structure (t, normal vector at point of intersection, primitive, bsdf).

    </h3>
    <p>
      To construct my BVH, I first decide what axis I want to split the primitives along. I do this by getting the
      extent of the bounding box of all the primitives and try to split along the longest axis. By default I split along
      the x axis, but if the y axis is longer than both other axes, then I split along the y axis and similarly for the
      z axis.
      <br><br>
      I then sort the primitives along the chosen axis by comparing the centroid's coordinate on the chosen axis of the
      primitives. I split the primitives into two equally sized groups based on this sorting, then recursively call
      construct_bvh on each half.

    <p>
      On my local Macbook Air M1 (base model) on battery power, I compared the execution time of the pathtracer with and
      without BVH acceleration, and as expected, the time with BVH acceleration was <strong>significantly</strong>
      faster than without. This is because without acceleration, the pathtracer has to check every single primitive in
      the scene for intersection with the ray, whereas with BVH acceleration, the pathtracer can prune the search space
      by checking only the primitives in the BVH nodes that intersect the ray by checking the bounding box of the node
      and ignoring nodes that the ray doesn't intersect with (thereby ignoring all the primitives in that node).
      The table below shows the execution time for each scene with and without BVH acceleration.

    </h3>
    <p>
      For hemisphere lighting, we take num_samples vector samples of the unit hemisphere on the bdsf of the
      intersection. For each vector sample, we create a light ray from the hit point along the direction of the sampled
      vector. We then see if the light ray intersects anything in the bvh, and if it does, then we get the emitted light
      from that object using the method described in lecture and divide by the pdf of the sampled vector, since we are
      estimating the lighting by monte carlo estimation. Finally, after taking all the samples, I divide by num_samples
      to complete the estimation.
      <br><br>
      For importance lighting, instead of sampling uniformly from the hemisphere at the intersection, we instead sample
      from the lights. We iterate over the lights, and for each light, we take ns_area_light samples of the light,
      unless it is a point light source which we only sample once. For each sample of a given light, we see if it
      intersects anything between the hit point and the light, and if it doesn't, then we add the emitted light from the
      light dividied by the pdf similarly to how we do it for hemisphere lighting. After sampling as much as necessary
      for a given light, we add the samples divided by the number of samples we used to the output, and ultimately
      return this lighting output.

      As we can see, the noise level on the soft shadows gradually becomes smoother and less noisy as we increase the
      number of light rays. With low levels of light rays, the color difference between the hard and soft parts of the
      shadow is less clear. This is because as we increase the number of light rays, we are sampling more of the light,
      and thus we are getting a more accurate estimate of the lighting.

    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Uniform hemisphere sampling samples vectors from a point out in all directions in the hemisphere. This means that
      some of the sampled vectors will contribute little to even nothing at all to the irradiance of that point. This is
      because some of the vectors might not point towards a light source, so even with the same number of light rays,
      the image when using hemisphere lighting will look noisier or darker than the same settings when using importance
      lighting. Lighting sampling is better because we sample vectors from the light sources instead, which will likely
      contribute more to the lighting on the point. This means that we will get a more accurate estimate of the
      lighting, and therefore the image will look less noisy and more accurate.

      First, I reuse my old code in one_bounce_radiance and add that to L_out. Then I use the pseudocode from lecture as

      0.4 range given), and if the russian roulette check passes, I perform much of the same operations as I do in the
      other lighting functions. I sample a ray from the intersection, create a new ray incident to the intersection and
      reduce the new ray's depth by one. Then, if the new ray's depth is greater than 0 and it intersects an object, I
      recursively call the indirect lighting function and use that to add to L_out using the formula outlined in

      With m=0, we only see the light source on the ceiling and nothing else since we are only seeing light that has no
      bouncing at all, so all the light coming from the scene to the camera is just the light emitting from the light
      source.
      <br>
      With m=1, we get only the direct lighting, so only light rays that directly come from the light source to an
      object are visible. Similar to the direct illumination image of the spheres from the previous section, the ceiling
      is completely black and the shadows on the floor are very dark while the top of the bunny is bright.
      <br>
      When m=2, we start to see some of the indirect illumination come through. The ceiling is now lit up, and the
      bottom sides of the bunny have light on them now, with the left side of the bunny having some red color from the
      red wall and the right side having some blue color from the blue wall. The shadows on the floor are not as dark as
      they were before.
      <br>
      When m=3, the shadows on the floor are even lighter than they were when m=2, and we see more of the red and blue
      colors on the bunny from the walls. In general, there appears to be more light in the scene.
      <br>
      For m=100, we see similar effects of the step between m=2 and m=3, though it is harder to see. The room does
      appear to be brighter.

      As we increase the number of samples per pixel, the image gradually becomes less noisy, with the jump between 64
      and 1024 samples being the most notable. The 1024 samples per pixel image is much clearer than the other images.

    <h3>
      Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of the adaptive sampling.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Adaptive sampling is an optimization to pixel raytracing by reducing the number of samples we calculate for a
      pixel that we determined has converged. At a high level, for each pixel whenever we calculate samplesPerBatch
      number of samples for that pixel, we check if the pixel has converged with a 95% confidence, and if it has, then
      we stop sampling for that pixel.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my particular implementation of adaptive sampling, I keep track of s1 and s2 variables which are the summations
      of each sample's illumination and the square of each sample's illumination respectively. Whenever I calculate
      samplesPerBatch number of samples for a pixel, I check if the pixel has converged with a 95% confidence by
      calculating the mean and variance of the samples so far, defining a variable
    <pre align="middle">I = 1.96 * σ / sqrt(n)</pre> If this value is less than or equal to the max tolerance * mean,
    then I consider it converged and stop sampling for the pixel.
    </p>
