    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I implemented logic for bezier curves and surfaces in section 1, and then went onto
      implement
      various mesh functionality in section 2. Specifically, in section 2, I implemented the logic for area
      weighted
      vertex normals, edge flipping, edge splitting, and mesh upsampling through loop subdivision.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


    <b>
      Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
    </b>
    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to compute points on a bezier curve given a set of
      control
      points. Essentially, it recursively calculates points between each adjacent control point pair using a given
      parameter t until we are left with one point, which is our final point on the curve evaluated at parameter
      t. I
      implemented a single step of this algorithm in 2D in this part by creating a new vector of points consisting
      of
      the calculated "midpoint" between each adjacent control point pair. Later in part 2, I implement a function
      that
      fully evaluates a bezier curve given a set of control points and a parameter t.
    </p>
    <br>


    <b>

      choosing.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to
      evaluate Bezier surfaces.
    </b>
    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces by first evaluating the Bezier curve at each row
      of
      the n x n control points matrix evaluated at a given u value. We now have n points, which we further
      evaluate
      using de Casteljau's algorithm again at a given v value. This gives us a single point on the surface
      evaluated at
      u and v.
      <br>
      To implement this, I rewrote what is essentially the same method as what I wrote in part 1 but for 3D
      vectors.
      Then, I wrote a function that would fully evaluate the algorithm for a vector of points at a given scalar
      value.
      Finally, I implemented a full evaluate function that would output a 3D point on the surface evaluated at u
      and v
      following the procedure I described above.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
    </b>
    <p>
      To calculate the area-weighted vertex normals, I iterate over the faces adjacent to the vertex, calculate their
      areas, then use that to weight the normal of each face, adding them all together. At the end, I normalize the
      result and spit it back.
      <br>
      <br>
      To calculate the area of a face, I get the vectors from the first vertex to the second and third vertices, then
      take the cross product of those two vectors. The magnitude of the resulting vector divided by 2 is the area of the
      triangle. This is multiplied by the normal of the face and added to a running total of the weighted normals that
      is normalized at the end.

    <p>
      First, I check if the edge is a boundary edge, and if it is, I return immediately. Then, I get all relevant mesh
      structures like halfedges, edges, vertexes, and faces. I used the picture of a before and after on the project
      spec page to help me understand what mesh structure in the before corresponded to what mesh structure in the
      after. For every mesh structure, I reassign it's related pointers even if it might not have changed, as per the
      advice on the spec. I feel like this helped a lot as it made me consider every possible thing that could have
      changed and might have led to me not having to debug anything! (luckily)

    <p>
      Similarly to how I implemented the edge flip, I first check for a boundary edge and return if it is one (I didn't
      do the extra credit). I then get all relevant mesh structures and create new mesh structures for the new elements
      that exist after the split. I use the before and after pictures in the spec again to guide the way that I identify
      and assign the relevant pointers for each mesh structure. Didn't have to debug!

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation /
      debugging
      tricks you have used.
    </b>
    <p>
      To implement loop subdivision, I essentially followed the recommended way to do it in the spec and in the comments
      of the skeleton. First, I precompute the new positions of all "old" vertices in the input mesh using the formula
      described in the spec. This takes into account all neighboring vertex positions. Then, I precompute the updated
      vertex positions of new vertices that will be created when splitting each edge. Next, I split every original edge
      in the mesh and set the position of the new vertex to its precomputed position. I then flip every new edge that
      connects an old and a new vertex, and finally, I set the position of the old vertices to their precomputed
      positions.
      <br>
      In terms of implementation, I had to edit my edge split function a little bit to correctly set the isNew property
      of the appropriate edges and new vertex, but other than that, I mostly stuck to the way that it was recommended to
      do it in the spec and in the comments of the skeleton. I didn't have to debug anything!
    </p>
    <br>


    <b>
      Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop
      subdivision.
      What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
    </b>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      After loop subdivision, the mesh becomes smoother and more rounded. You can see this very clearly in the below
      images, as the torus becomes a lot less sharp and more rounded to become a lot more like a rounded ring/donut.
      Sharp corners and edges get rounded out as more vertices and edges get added to the mesh, which allows for a
      smoother surface. The shape also typically sees a reduction in total volume. If you pre-split some edges, some
      sharp corners and edges can remain flat/sharp even after loop subdivision.

      Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes
      slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so
      that
      the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your
      pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
    </b>
    <p>
      After several iterations of loop subdivision, the cube definitely becomes slightly asymmetric. This is because
      each face of the cube only has one edge splitting it across a diagonal instead of two edges (or four technically)
      going across both diagonals. Due to the way that loop subdivision works to upsample meshes, this results in an
      asymmetrical mesh. If we pre process the cube, splitting the diagonal edge across each face, we will arrive at a
      symmetric mesh at the end.
