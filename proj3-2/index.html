        Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
      </b></p>
    <p>
      Going from m=0 to m=1, we can see the light hitting the walls and the floors, as well as a bit on the balls
      themselves. In m=2, the ceiling gets lit up, and we can see the mirror ball reflecting the floor and walls but not
      the ceiling yet. The glass ball is still quite dark, though we can see a bit of the room that is reflected from
      the mirror ball. In m=3, we can see the mirror ball now has the ceiling lit up, and near the bottom, we get a hint
      of red from the red reflecting off the wall to the floor to the ball. The glass ball finally gets some good color,
      as we can see how it refracts the light coming to it. The floor beneath the glass ball gets a caustic of light. In
      m=4, the reflection of the glass ball in the mirror ball finally gets some color, with it looking blue like the
      wall behind you. The bottom of the glass ball also shows the caustic beneath it. There is also a new light spot on
      the blue wall from the glass ball. From m=4 to m=5, we don't really see any new multibounce effects. At m=100, we
      don't see anything especially new either.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>
        Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all
        screenshots.
      </b></p>
    <p>
      At m=0, we only see the direct light sources, since the light rays coming from the light source to the camera are
      the only ones that should be visible. At m=1, we can additionally see lights that bounce once off an object into
      the camera. Therefore, we see the walls and floors, as well as the parts of the balls that reflect the light
      source into the camera. At m=2, the ceiling is now lit up from light reflected from other parts of the scene. In
      addition, the mirror ball can now reflect parts of the scene that have bounced once into the ball. At m=3, the
      mirror ball can now reflect the light rays that have bounced twice, so we see the ceiling and part of the red
      shadow of the left wall reflected in the ball. The light rays going into the glass ball can now fully refract
      through and hit the camera. At m=4, the mirror ball can reflect the can now also reflect the light coming from the
      glass ball. The bottom of the glass ball can also now refract the light rays coming from its caustic, and we see
      another light spot on the blue wall.

        and your importance sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples

    <p>
      The cosine hemisphere sampling image has signficantly more noise than the importance sampling image, especially on
      the bunny itself. We can see a bit of the walls and ceiling reflected in the metal bunny, but there are a lot more
      white dot noisiness compared to the importance sampling image. In that image, there is still some white noise, but
      the bunny looks significantly better and recognizable.
